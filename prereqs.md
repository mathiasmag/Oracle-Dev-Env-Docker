# Prerequisites

## Install Docker

Choose Docker CE whenever possible.

Installing docker is easy no matter what platform you are on. For platforms and flavors documenhted by docker, just use their [instructions](https://docs.docker.com/install/).

For Red Hat, follow their instructions. They do not install Docker CE, you'll get the older docker-engine. Though it is possible to install Docker CE from Cent OS if you do not need a configuration Red HAt will support.

Oracle Linux supports Docker CE even though it is built on Red Hat. Follow this [blog](https://blogs.oracle.com/virtualization/install-docker-on-oracle-linux-7-v2) to install it on Oracle Linux 7.
